Welcome to Zelda 2 the Adventure of Link!


This game is a tribute to the famous Zelda video game franchise, and more specifically to Zelda 2 the Adventure of Link.


To play, you'll need a terminal or console that supports special characters and colors.


To start the game, you'll need python: run the file main.py with the command python3 main.py in your terminal.


The keys and how to play are explained directly in the game.


The display requires the execution of ANSII escape sequences.


For the game to display properly, we strongly recommend that you set your terminal to full screen.


We hope you enjoy the game.
